WPF MVVM With StructureMap
=======================

A simple WPF MVVM application with Structure Map for dependency injection.

This project was put together to support a tutorial written on [JPreeceDev.com](http://jpreecedev.com/2013/07/26/achieving-mvvm-purity-using-an-inversion-of-control-ioc-container-part-1-of-2/) which discusses how to write a pure WPF MVVM implementation (as little code behind as we can get away with!).
